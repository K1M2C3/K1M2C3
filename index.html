    <!--Text above the pictures that tell a little about animals testing history.-->
  
    <p id="History"> Companies have been using animals from the earliest of the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE, all the way to today. Animal testing didn't become a problem until 1938, when the united states food, drug and cosmetic act was signed into law, making it so there is some safety substantiation of cosmetic products.</p>
